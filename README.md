# Autonomous Robot Navigation with Trapezoidal Velocity Profile

This repository contains code and resources for implementing autonomous robot navigation using a trapezoidal velocity profile. The robot is designed to follow a given position using this velocity profile, ensuring smooth and efficient movement.

## Features

- **Trapezoidal Velocity Profile:** The robot's movement is controlled using a trapezoidal velocity profile, allowing for precise and controlled navigation.
- **Position Following:** The robot is programmed to follow a given position, making it suitable for applications requiring accurate positioning.
- **Codebase:** The repository includes the codebase for controlling the robot's movement and implementing the trapezoidal velocity profile.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
